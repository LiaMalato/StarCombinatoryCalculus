# Star Combinatory Calculus and a herbrandized version of Shoenfield's functional interpretation

This repository accompanies the Master's Degree in Mathematics dissertation entitled "On the Star Combinatory Calculus: formalization and applications to classical logic" from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (Portugal). The goal of this repository is to provide the code to formalize certain notions that are studied from a mathematical point of view in Sections 1 to 3 of said dissertation.

The files in this repository accompany the structure of the dissertation:
  1. StarLanguage: folder corresponding to the first section
     
       a) FiniteTypes: definitions and examples of finite types (corresponding to Section 1.1)
     
       b) Syntax: syntax of the Star Combinatory Language (Section 1.2.1)
     
       c) Axioms: axiomatic of the corresponding theory (Section 1.2.2)
     
       d) CombinatorialCompleteness: the formalization of the Combinatorial Completeness Theorem (Section 2.1)
     
  2. SHFunctInterp: folder corresponding to the second section with the formalization of the herbrandized version of Shoenfield's functional interpretation and associated results
  3. Soundness: folder corresponding to the third section with the formalization of the Soundness Theorem and other results (future work)
